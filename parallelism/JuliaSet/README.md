# GPU-Accelerated juliaSet Renderer
## Overview
This project demonstrates the power of GPU parallel computing in rendering complex fractal images, specifically the Julia Set. By leveraging the high concurrency offered by modern GPUs, we can compute the intricate patterns of the Julia Set much faster than traditional CPU-based computations.
## Julia Set

The Julia Set is a famous fractal named after the French mathematician Gaston Julia. It's known for its intricate and beautiful patterns that emerge from iterating a simple complex quadratic polynomial. The set is defined in the complex plane and exhibits complex, self-similar patterns at various scales.

## GPU Parallel Computing

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are highly efficient in handling parallel tasks due to their large number of cores designed for high throughput. This project utilizes the parallel processing capability of GPUs to compute the Julia Set. Each point in the set is calculated independently, making it an ideal candidate for parallelization.

## Implementation
- Technologies Used
1. CUDA/OpenCL: Used for writing GPU-accelerated computations.
2. OpenGL/DirectX: For rendering the computed fractal on the screen.
3. C++/Python: Primary programming language for the project.
- Key Features
**Parallel Computation**: Each pixel's value is computed in parallel on the GPU, resulting in significant performance improvements.
**Dynamic Zooming**: Real-time zooming and panning to explore different parts of the Julia Set.
**Color Mapping**: Converts the iteration count to colors for a visually appealing representation of the fractal.
